# Singular_Exotic_Perturbation
This project implements Adil Reghai and Florian Monciaud's paper, "Singular Exotic Perturbation."

# Project to do list
1) Get a local volatility function.
2) Compute value of exotic (a barrier option say) under LV.
3) Implement the Reghai formula for the LSV-LV adjustment

## Phase 1 of the project is now done.

4) Get simple LSV spec.  Generate European option prices
5) Compute local volatility.  By definition, vanilla prices under LSV and LV should match.
6) Compute value of exotic (a barrier option say) under LSV.
7) Check against the Reghai formula.
